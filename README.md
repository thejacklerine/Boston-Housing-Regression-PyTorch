# Boston-Housing-Regression-PyTorch
A machine learning regression model built with PyTorch to predict Boston housing prices using 13 input features. Includes data preprocessing, training pipeline, evaluation metrics, and visualization of results.


üè° Boston Housing Price Prediction

This project implements a regression model using **PyTorch** to predict housing prices in Boston.  
The dataset contains **13 features** (e.g., crime rate, number of rooms, property tax, etc.) and one target variable: **median house value**.

## üìå Features
- Data preprocessing (normalization & train/validation split)
- Neural network regression model (PyTorch)
- Training with **MSELoss** and **Adam optimizer**
- Early stopping to prevent overfitting
- Model evaluation with metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R¬≤
- Visualization of predictions vs. true values
